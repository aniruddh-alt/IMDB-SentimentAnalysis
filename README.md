# IMDB Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT

## Project Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using DistilBERT, a lightweight version of BERT, to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. The goal is to determine whether a review expresses a positive or negative sentiment.

### Key Features

- **Model:** DistilBERT, a smaller, faster variant of BERT, provides efficient and accurate sentiment classification.
- **Dataset:** IMDB movie reviews dataset, widely used for training and evaluating sentiment analysis models.
- **Functionality:** Trains a sentiment analysis model and makes predictions on new movie reviews.

This project demonstrates the application of transfer learning with DistilBERT for natural language processing tasks, specifically sentiment classification.
